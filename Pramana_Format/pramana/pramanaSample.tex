\begin{abstract}
Machine Learning has shown substantial impact on Scientific Computing in recent years. The adaptation of ML techniques to deal with various research problems in Physical Science have gained ground as an alternative to the existing Numerical Schemes. In this paper, we would like to introduce the reader to a basic Neural Networks(NN) that can solve Ordinary Differential Equations and Partial Differential Equations. In Particular we choose First and Second Order equations to illustrate the proficiency of Neural Network over traditional numerical techniques. This paper will be helpful for any Graduate and Undergraduate students and also as an introductory material to any new researcher who wants to apply Machine Learning techniques to their problem of interest.

\section{Introduction}
Differential equations plays an important role in the development of any modern science such as in Physics(Heat Transfer), Biology(Exponential Growth and Decay), Economics(Banking Interest) and many more applications can be found in literature. In general Differential Equation is an equation which maps the functions values with its derivatives values. It can be classified into two large groups namely Linear Equations and Nonlinear Equations and an ordinary differential equation is that a function with one variable whereas partial differential equation does depend on several variables. Most of the Nonlinear differential equations are difficult to solve using analytical techniques which leads one to rely on numerical techniques. There are several numerical schemes which can be used to solve differential equations such as Finite Difference Scheme,Finite Element Method, Crank Nicholson Scheme, etc. These methods do depend on numerical differentiation which relies on the mesh which is in general known as grids. But Machine Learning techniques adopts Automatic Differentiation which is a mesh-free approach.
