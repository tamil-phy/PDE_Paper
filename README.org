* DONE restructure code layout into one directory per task [2/2]
  tasks as in (harmonic_1d, van_der_pol_2d, ...) 
** DONE move model out of ==nn/=
   and reuse =Trainer=, =Model= , =Dataset= classes inside task directories
** DONE move data generation scripts into task directories 
* DONE LSTM based timeseries modelling of the data [2/2]
** DONE TSDataset and TSModel 
*** DONE using sliding window to create pseudo samples
** DONE plot_results_(XY|TS) to plot outputs
* DONE [#A] fix data generation -- was an refactor error
  - looks like there is some line added to the data generated
* TODO test models on outside the trained time range
* TODO pull the common code from model.py under tasks 
** TODO split possible variables into configs?
* TODO separate experiments separate py scripts
  code duplication is okay for now.
